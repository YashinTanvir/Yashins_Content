# Health Risk Profile Visualization Tool

This repository includes the code for a basic **Health Risk Profile Visualization Tool**. This tool, created in Python with the help of **Streamlit** and **Plotly**, enables users to enter demographic and lifestyle data to get a broad health risk evaluation. It aims to assist users in understanding their positioning within specific health risk classifications, considering factors like **BMI**, **age**, **smoking habits**, and **number of children**. Furthermore, it provides a visual comparison of the user's inputs against a larger dataset.

## Context

In the field of healthcare, recognizing significant health risk determinants such as BMI, age, and smoking status can aid in pinpointing individuals who may benefit from specific healthcare interventions. This tool offers users a fundamental health risk evaluation, assisting them in understanding their positioning within broader risk categories based on these attributes.

Inspired by initial health screening methods, this tool illustrates how data-driven solutions can enhance health awareness. While it remains an elementary tool, it showcases the potential for utilizing data science to provide personalized health insights.
